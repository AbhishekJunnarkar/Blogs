In this simple example using AWS Step-Funtions I am going to realize a Approval workflow process for a use-case that involves metadata content creation, human approval or rejection and moving the metadata to active state.

Step
- Create content
- State: Draft
Step 
- Approve content 
- State: Draft to Review
Step
- Publish content
- State: Review to Active
